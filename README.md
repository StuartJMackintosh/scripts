# scripts
Some old and new hacky scripts to automate stuff

A selection of hobbyist-quality Bash and Perl scripts.

Note that these are developed as quick and rough ways to do things. Please help yourself, and send back any comments or improvements with PR's. I will probably accept any PR's as this is not meant to be production-grade. As the license notes, use at your own risk.
