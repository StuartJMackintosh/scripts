# Simple 5 line blockchain in bash for Linux & MacOS

## Preparation

You just need a terminal open on your Linux or Mac (maybe also Windows with WSL) and running ```bash```
  -  Bash is the GNU Project's shellâ€”the Bourne Again SHell. This is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.

## Tools

We will use the following tools:

variables
: places to store a thing in the computer for later

expansion
: get the output of one command, inside another

array
: a variable, for a list of items instead of just one

for loop
: run through each item in the array

## Commands

we will use the following commands: 

- ```read``` - to ask for input
- ```date``` - to get the current time to add to the block
- ```echo``` - to show us what is in the variable (like print) 
- ```shasum``` - to create a signature/stamp of our text 


## Line 1: Get input

First, lets enter some text using the ```read``` command and store in the ```INPUT``` variable

```bash

read -p "Type text here about love, then press enter > " INPUT
```

## Line 2: Create a block

Now we will add to the variable ```BLOCK```, the current date (using expansion, to run the date command, and include the output within the variable), then the contents of ```INPUT```

```bash
BLOCK="$(date +%T) $BLOCKSUM $INPUT"
```

## Line 3: Sum the block

To get a sum of our BLOCK, we use a 'SHA algorithm' (you can research if you want using this command:
- The program sha256sum is designed to verify data integrity using the SHA-256 (SHA-2 family with a digest length of 256 bits). SHA-256 hashes used properly can confirm both file integrity and authenticity.)

```bash
BLOCKSUM="$(echo -n $BLOCK | shasum -a 256 )"
```

## Line 4: Chain the block

Add the sum and block to the chain of blocks
```bash
BLOCKCHAIN+=("$BLOCKSUM $BLOCK")
```

## Line 5: Show the BlockChain

for each block in the chain, send to the screen what we have recorded using a for loop

```bash
for B in "${BLOCKCHAIN[@]}"; do echo Block: "$B"; done
```

# Script

As a script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

clear

echo "Simple blockchain in bash"

# First, lets store some text in a block, following the date, and last block sum
read -p "Type text here, then press enter > " INPUT
BLOCK="$(date +%T) $BLOCKSUM $INPUT"
# next, we get a new sum from the block
BLOCKSUM=$(echo -n $BLOCK | shasum -a 256 )

Add the sum and block to the chain of blocks
BLOCKCHAIN+=("$BLOCKSUM $BLOCK")

# for each block in the chain, show what we have recorded
for B in "${BLOCKCHAIN[@]}"; do echo Block: "$B"; done

```
